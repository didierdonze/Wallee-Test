            <p>Our extension connects Odoo shop user to the payment hub, which has more than 50 payment gateways and processors linked to it. The Connector works with the help of the Rest API&#39;s. This reduces the tendency of customers abandoning their cart when their preferred payment gateway is missing in the payment page. It also connects the user to the different payment service provider APIs and thereby lowering the costs of using payment routing.</p>
            <p><b>Please note that the extension is priced at 150 EUR. If you need setup and integration done by PIT Solutions, there is an additional one time fee of 100 EUR.</b></p>

            <p>wallee back-end provides a configuration wherein one can define the Payment methods to be enabled for users. In addition to this, admin has the flexibility to specify for the payment completion process the user should be redirected to the service’s provider’s site or handled within shop site as I-frame.
            It depends on the payment service provider whether the gateway can be handled via redirection or I-frame or both. </p>
            <p>For an additional security level in the payment process, Admin can enable the 3D secure functionality in the wallee back-end. If enabled, then during the checkout process user would be directed to the 3D secure service of the payment method and the details would be handled there.</p>
            <p>Admin can change the notification contents in the back-end, for cases when the payment is pending, completed, cancelled or an error occurs. Other system notifications are help message when the Help option is used and Thanks message on completion of the order placement. Similarly, the order emails, invoices, reminders, packing slips and many more can be edited as per one’s format.</p>
